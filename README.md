## **Introduction**

**TixVibe Microservices** is built with a clear focus on delivering a high-performance, scalable platform capable of supporting millions of users. At its core, it adopts **microservices** architecture to decouple domains and scale independently while maintaining system reliability and performance under heavy traffic.

This project is driven by modern best practices in **distributed systems** and **cloud-native** technologies, integrating **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Redis**, **Bull.js**, and **NATS Streaming** to enable efficient service discovery, container orchestration, and asynchronous communication.

Key aspects of the design include:

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** to manage distributed transactions safely.
- **Database-per-service** approach to ensure domain isolation, which is key for scaling and fault tolerance.
- **Event-driven architecture** with NATS Streaming to ensure decoupled, asynchronous communication between services.
- A **shared common library** (`@tixvibe/common`) used across all services to ensure code consistency and reuse.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

### **Service Design and Communication**

The architecture is designed around the following principles:

#### **Microservices Isolation**

Each service is isolated with its own database and domain logic. This pattern, also known as **Database-per-Service**, ensures:

- **Fault isolation**: Failures in one service do not affect others.
- **Independent scaling**: Services can scale independently based on load and traffic.
- **Independent deployments**: New versions of services can be deployed independently without impacting others.

#### **Service Communication**

Services interact using **HTTP** for synchronous communication and **NATS Streaming** for asynchronous, event-driven communication. The use of NATS ensures:

- **Loose coupling** between services, allowing for easy extensibility and scalability.
- **Eventual consistency** in the system, as services handle events independently and asynchronously.

#### **API Design Consistency**

To provide consistency and flexibility, all services expose standardized **REST APIs** that:

- Use **JSON** as the data format, with fields such as `_id` parsed to `id` for easier integration with NoSQL databases.
- Return standardized error responses, which simplify handling errors in the frontend (Next.js).

#### **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**

For all services handling concurrent updates to critical resources (such as tickets or orders), we use **Optimistic Concurrency Control** (OCC). This approach helps:

- Mitigate race conditions in distributed systems.
- Safeguard data integrity by validating the state of resources before committing changes.

---

### **Event-Driven Microservices**

At the heart of **TixVibe** is an **event-driven architecture** that leverages **NATS Streaming Server** for reliable, asynchronous message passing between services. This approach allows decoupled communication, where services publish events and subscribe to others' events, enabling eventual consistency.

#### **Publishers and Listeners**

Each service implements a **publisher** to emit events and a **listener** to handle events emitted by other services. The events propagate business logic changes (e.g., a new ticket being created or an order being placed), ensuring that all services are eventually synchronized with the latest state.

The core of the event-driven system is the **Base Publisher** and **Base Listener** classes in the `@tixvibe/common` library, which abstract:

- Event emission: Services can easily publish events without needing to manually set up listeners.
- Event subscription: Services can listen for specific events from other services, maintaining a reactive flow of information.

By ensuring that each service is responsible for emitting and handling events related to its domain, we achieve a **highly decoupled architecture** that can scale horizontally, with minimal impact on other services during failure or changes.

#### **Handling Failures and Retries**

The use of **Bull.js** and **Redis** ensures that job expiration and retries are handled efficiently. Services can queue jobs (like ticket reservations) in Redis and retry them when necessary, ensuring reliability even under heavy load.

---

### **Database Strategy**

The microservices are structured around the **One Database per Service** pattern, where each service maintains its own database (MongoDB in this case). This approach ensures:

- **Data isolation**: No direct sharing of databases between services, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Service independence**: Each service can evolve and scale independently without needing to coordinate with other services' databases.
- **Redundancy**: Services can store relevant data in other servicesâ€™ databases if required (for example, the `Orders` service stores ticket data).

Additionally, the project implements **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** to prevent race conditions in distributed transactions, especially when services perform operations on the same resource simultaneously.

---

### **Design Patterns and Best Practices**

#### **Singleton Pattern**

A **singleton pattern** is used for managing single instances of critical components across the services:

- **NATS Streaming Client**: Each service shares the same instance of the NATS Streaming client, ensuring efficient communication without redundant connections.
- **MongoDB**: All database interactions use a singleton instance of the MongoDB connection to avoid connection pool overhead.

#### **Event Sourcing**

Although the system does not fully embrace Event Sourcing, the event-driven nature of the architecture ensures that key events (e.g., order created, ticket purchased) are stored and can be replayed for debugging or future processing.

---

## **Features**

- **Microservice Scalability**: Independent services that can scale based on demand.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling of services via NATS Streaming, promoting flexibility and scalability.
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: Prevents race conditions when updating critical resources.
- **Redis + Bull.js for Job Expiration and Retry Logic**: Ensures smooth job execution and reliable expiration of resources.
- **Load Balancing with NGINX Ingress**: Facilitates effective HTTP traffic distribution across services in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Service Discovery with Kubernetes**: Automatic service discovery and scaling using Kubernetes in both local and cloud environments.

## **Development and Deployment**

### **Local Development with Minikube**

For local development, **Minikube** provides an easy way to spin up a Kubernetes cluster on your machine:

1. **Start Minikube**:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```
2. **Configure hostfile**:
   Add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:
   ```text
   <MINIKUBE_IP> tixvibe.dev
   ```
3. **Enable Ingress and Tunnel**:
   ```bash
   minikube addons enable ingress
   minikube tunnel
   ```
4. **Deploy Services** using **Skaffold**:
   ```bash
   skaffold dev
   ```

### **Cloud Deployment on GCP and AWS**

#### **Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**

1. **Create Cluster**:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters create tixvibe-cluster --num-nodes=3
   ```
2. **Configure kubectl for GKE**:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials tixvibe-cluster
   ```
3. **Deploy Services**:
   ```bash
   skaffold run
   ```

   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name tixvibe-cluster
   ```
3. **Deploy Services**:
   ```bash
   skaffold run
   ```

---

## **Common Library (`@tixvibe/common`)**

The `@tixvibe/common` library contains shared code for microservices, including:

- **Base Publisher/Listener** for event-driven communication with NATS Streaming.
- **Utility functions** for logging, error handling, and authentication.
- **API DTOs** and models for consistent data structures across services.

This shared library allows developers to focus on core business logic without duplicating infrastructure code across services.
